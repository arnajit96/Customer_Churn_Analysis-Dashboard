#About the Project: 

The Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard is a Power BI-based initiative, focusing on the attrition rate, where customers cease their engagement with a company over a specified period. Churn may also encompass subscribers who cancel or opt not to renew a subscription. A higher churn rate indicates a greater number of customers discontinuing business, whereas a lower churn rate signifies improved customer retention.


#Data Collection: 
The dataset, comprising 7000+ records of customer information, was furnished as an Excel file by PwC, sourced from a telecom client during the PwC Power BI in Data Analytics Virtual Case Experience.             
It encompasses crucial fields such as Gender, Senior Citizen status, Tenure, Payment Method, Phone Service, Contract, Monthly Charge, Subscriptions, etc.
